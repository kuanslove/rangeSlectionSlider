rangeSlectionSlider
===================

During my daily work, I often come across some visualization interactive problem with some existing plugin, so I decide to write my own implementation from now on, this is the first one I used for real product.

This is my open source project about a D3.js/jQuery plugin to draw a range selection slider. Maybe export for AngularJS directive soon.
